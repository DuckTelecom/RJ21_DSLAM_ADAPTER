# RJ21_DSLAM_ADAPTER

This is an adapter / breakout aimed for use with the Zyxel AAM1212 DSLAM modules used in the IES-1000 chassis.

It takes 24 lines in on the "EXCHANGE" side, breaks them out to the two RJ21 connectors on the DSLAM, then recombines 24 lines with ADSL on the the "DISTRIBUTION" side.

**Note: It's currently untested. I will update this repo once the board has been manufactured and tested**
